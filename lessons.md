# Interview Lessons Learned

## 1. Articulation is Key for Leadership Roles
- Clear thinking is fundamental - organize your thoughts before speaking
- Deep domain knowledge helps you explain complex concepts simply
- Strong writing skills translate to better verbal communication
- Practice explaining technical concepts to non-technical people
- Use analogies and real-world examples to make your point

## 2. Technical Communication
During a technical interview, I was asked to explain a complex SQL query. I jumped straight into the code without setting context, which made the interviewer struggle to follow my thought process.

Always structure your technical explanations in this order:
1. What's the problem we're trying to solve?
2. What's my approach?
3. Why this approach?
4. Here's the code/implementation
5. What are the trade-offs?

## 3. Handling Ambiguous Questions
In a product analytics interview, I was asked: "How would you measure the success of a new feature?" I started listing metrics without first understanding the context and goals.

When faced with ambiguous questions:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. State your assumptions
3. Explain your reasoning
4. Be ready to pivot based on new information

## 4. Data Quality First
During a take-home assignment, I focused on building the perfect model without first checking data quality. The interviewer pointed out several data issues I had missed.

Always start with data quality checks:
1. Check for missing values and their patterns
2. Look for outliers and anomalies
3. Verify data consistency
4. Validate against business rules
5. Document your assumptions

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't jump straight to solutions without understanding the problem
- Don't make assumptions without stating them
- Don't ignore the business context
- Don't forget to explain your thought process
- Don't skip the basics (data quality, edge cases, etc.)

## 6. What Interviewers Really Look For
- Can you think clearly and communicate effectively?
- Do you understand the business impact of your work?
- Can you handle ambiguity and make reasonable assumptions?
- Are you systematic in your approach?
- Can you learn from feedback and adapt?
