## Resources I Found Useful

There are tons of guides out there on how to break into data and ML roles. Here's what worked for me over the years:

### For Beginners
- [SQL Cookbook](https://www.amazon.in/SQL-Cookbook-Query-Solutions-Techniques-ebook/dp/B08P3XYBM1) – A solid book to build strong fundamentals
- [Code with Harry](https://www.codewithharry.com/) – Great for beginner-friendly tutorials
- [WorldQuant University ADSL](https://www.wqu.edu/adsl) – A free course covering Python and data science basics

### Experimentation & A/B Testing
- [Interview Query – A/B Testing](https://www.interviewquery.com/p/statistics-ab-testing-interview-questions)
- [Medium – Top A/B Testing Questions](https://tatevkarenaslanyan.medium.com/mastering-a-b-testing-top-20-questions-and-answers-to-ace-your-data-science-interview-d8bf49f20b53)

### Machine Learning
- Andrew Ng's ML course on Coursera
- The 100-Page ML Book
- Be confident about your projects – they'll matter most
- Jay Alammar – excellent visual explanations

> If I had to start over, I'd probably go straight for an MS, especially for product/data science roles. Will keep updating this section.
